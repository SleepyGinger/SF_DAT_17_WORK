# read in the CSV file from a URL
drinks = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sinanuozdemir/SF_DAT_15/master/data/drinks.csv', na_filter=False)


# 1. Show the first 17 rows of drinks
drinks.head(17))

# 2. create a variable called beer_servings and use it to store the beer_servings column
beer_servings=drinks[['beer_servings']]

# 3. Display a dataframe where the only rows are those with continent North America
drinks[drinks.continent=='NA']

# 4. Create a new dataframe called north_america that holds your answer in 1.
# drinks (the dataframe) should remain unchanged



# 5. What is the average wine consumption per person per year in Africa?
drinks[drinks.continent=='AF'].mean()
16.26

# 6. Create a scatter plot between spirit servings and wine servings of all countries
drinks.plot(x='spirit_servings', y='wine_servings', kind='scatter', alpha=0.3)


# 7. Show a list of the top 10 spirit drinking countries 
# (show only country names and spirit servings)
drinks.sort('spirit_servings', ascending=False).head(10)[['country','spirit_servings']]

# 8. Plot 6 histograms of wine servings by continent, 
# remember to share x and share y axis scales!
drinks.wine_servings.hist(by=drinks.continent, sharex=True, sharey=True))

# 9. What is the average wine consumption in South America
drinks[drinks.continent=='SA'].mean()
# 10. Which continent has the highest on average wine consumption?
drinks.groupby('continent').wine_servings.mean()
