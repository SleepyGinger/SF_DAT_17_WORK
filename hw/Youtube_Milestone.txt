YOUTUBE

When looking at a user's youtube video page finding popular videos by that author is difficuly. Youtube offers
sorting videos by view count and date published. In this program I have utlilized the view count along with, like
count, dislike count, and comment count to make finding the most interesting video easier.

You can also find videos via the search method so you are not limited to one user's videos.

I would like to incorporate tags (up too 10 words defined by the user), title of the video, and description.
