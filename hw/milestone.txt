I will be working on both projects, but my heart is in the Youtube one, but not sure how I can use machine learning
techniques learned.

NLTK

When exporting news about a certain topic a lot of trash is incorporated. Traditionally finding the trash meant either manually looking through each article or using boolean search methods. Using boolean restricts how many articles comes in. I would like to use machine learning to swift through all the trash and take out only relevant articles.

Once relevant articles are exported, I would like to take out interesting words and graph that throught time.

YOUTUBE

When looking at a user's youtube video page finding popular videos by that author is difficuly. Youtube offers
sorting videos by view count and date published. In this program I have utlilized the view count along with, like
count, dislike count, and comment count to make finding the most interesting video easier.

You can also find videos via the search method so you are not limited to one user's videos.

I would like to incorporate tags (up too 10 words defined by the user), title of the video, and description.

A working program is at https://github.com/SleepyGinger/youtube_stats. If you have trouble getting your API Key
message me and I can give you mine.)
